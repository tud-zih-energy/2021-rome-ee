Data-dependent Power Consumption
================================

These plots show the data-dependent power consumption, i.e., how much does the power consumption differ for two instructions executed in a tight loop, depending on the input data.

> Note: We used some of the generated graphs for Figure 10 in the paper.

Reproduction of results
=======================

The folder contains the executed program and the results directly produced from running the compiled executable. However, the total system power used in the visualization script is dynamically requested from our local measurement infrastructure.

RAM latency
===========

These plots show the RAM latency measured using [BenchIT](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/forschung/projekte/benchit).

> Note: We used some of these graphs for Figure 5b in the paper.

Reproduction of results
=======================

The `datafiles` folders contain all measurement data that were recorded using [BenchIT](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/forschung/projekte/benchit). The folders contain `.bit` files, which include setup information and results for each measurement, as well as accompanying `.gp` files, which may be used create plots of individual measurements using `gnuplot`.

L3 Cache frequencies
====================

These plots show the  L3-cache latencies in a mixed frequency set-up.

> Note: We used some of these graphs for Figure 4 in the paper.

Reproduction of results
=======================

While the `datafiles` folders contain all measurement data, the measurement tool is not part of this repository. However, we used [BenchIT](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/forschung/projekte/benchit) to record the data.

C-state transition latencies
============================

These plots show the C-state transition times depending on the caller and callee in different positions.

> Note: We used some of these graphs for Figure 9 in the paper.

Reproduction of results
=======================

While the folder `datafiles` contains all measurement data, the measurement tool is not part of this repository. However, we used perf to record the data and a simple program described in the paper.

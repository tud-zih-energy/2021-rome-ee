Throughput of the memory hierarchy
==================================

These plots show the throughput (or bandwidth) for the L1, L2, and L3 caches, as well as the RAM banks.
The plots include different frequencies and core counts.

Reproduction of results
=======================

While the folder `datafiles` contains all measurement data, the measurement tool is not part of this repository. However, we used [BenchIT](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/forschung/projekte/benchit) to record the data.
